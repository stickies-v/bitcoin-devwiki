# Testing Guide: Bitcoin Core 23.0 Release Candidate

_For feedback on this guide, please visit [#24706](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24706)._

This document outlines some of the upcoming Bitcoin Core 23.0 release changes and provides steps to help test them. This is meant to get you started on testing, but is in no way comprehensive! After running through the steps in this guide, you are _encouraged_ to do your own testing.

This can be as simple as testing the same features in this guide but trying it a different way. Even better, think of features you use regularly and test that they still work as expected in the release candidate. You can also read the [release notes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/23.0-Release-Notes-draft) to find something not covered in this guide. This is a great way to be involved with Bitcoin's development and helps keep Bitcoin running smoothly and bug-free! Your help in this endeavor is _greatly_ appreciated.

## Overview

Changes covered in this testing guide include:

- Simple GUI test to ensure we can boot up and perform basic operations on the (now default) descriptor wallet.
- The strong preference for only connecting to peers that listen to the standard port 8333 has been removed.  ([#23542](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23542))
- Full support for CJDNS network has been added. ([#23077](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23077))
- Native arm64-apple-darwin binaries for Apple Silicon (M1) are now available. ([#21851](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21851))
- SHA256 optimization on ARMv8 ([#24115](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24115))


For a comprehensive list of changes in `23.0`, check out the [release notes](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/23.0-Release-Notes-draft).

## Preparation

#### 1. Grab Latest Release Candidate

**Current Release Candidate:** [Bitcoin Core 23.0rc3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v23.0rc3) [(changelog)](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/23.0-Release-Notes-Draft)

There are two ways to grab the latest release candidate: pre-compiled binary or source code.
The source code for the latest release can be grabbed from here: [latest release source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v23.0rc3).

If you want to use a binary, make sure to [grab the correct one](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-23.0/test.rc3/) for your system. _(If you're using the arm64-apple-darwin binaries, see the [additional installation instructions](#getting-started) further down regarding a necessary code signing step.)_

#### 2. Compile Release Candidate

**If you grabbed a binary, skip this step.**

Before compiling, make sure that your system has all the right dependencies installed. As this guide utilizes the Bitcoin Core GUI, you must compile support for the GUI and have the `qt5` dependency already installed. Since descriptor wallets are now default, it is recommended that you compile with sqlite, so make sure you have installed the `sqlite3` dependency. If you want to disable non-descriptor wallets entirely by compiling without Berkeley DB, you can do so by appending `--without-bdb` to the `./configure` command below.

To ensure we build in sqlite and gui support, pass the following options when configuring:

```shell
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-gui=yes --with-sqlite=yes --enable-suppress-external-warnings
# nproc does not exist on macOS so we create an alias for it if necessary
if ! command -v nproc &> /dev/null; then alias nproc="sysctl -n hw.physicalcpu"; fi  
make -j "$(($(nproc)+1))"
```

For more information on compiling from source, here are some guides to compile Bitcoin Core for [UNIX/Linux](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md), [macOS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md), [Windows](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md), [FreeBSD](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-freebsd.md), [NetBSD](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-netbsd.md), and [OpenBSD](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-openbsd.md).

#### 3. Setting up command line environment

If you plan to use the command line, below are a few environment variables to set.

First, create a temporary data directory:


``` bash
export DATA_DIR=/tmp/23-rc-test
mkdir $DATA_DIR
```

Next, specify the following paths. For source compiled, start from the root of your release candidate directory and run:

```shell
export BINARY_PATH=$(pwd)/src
export QT_PATH=$(pwd)/src/qt
```

For the downloaded binary, start from the root of the downloaded release candidate (`cd ~/bitcoin-23.0rc3`, for example) and run:

```shell
export BINARY_PATH=$(pwd)/bin
export QT_PATH=$BINARY_PATH
```

The commands throughout the rest of the guide will look like:

```shell
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR [cli args]

# for starting bitcoin-qt
$QT_PATH/bitcoin-qt -datadir=$DATA_DIR [cli args]
```

Note: Between sections in this guide, it's recommended to stop your node and wipe the data directory. You can use the commands provided below.

**Stop node**

```shell
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR stop
```

**Wipe and recreate the directory**

```shell
rm -r $DATA_DIR
mkdir $DATA_DIR
```

**Start node**

```shell
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoind -datadir=$DATA_DIR -daemon
```

**Using QT**

If you're not comfortable with the command line, still test all of these changes in the GUI after making the appropriate conf file changes. To run bitcoin-qt, use:

```shell
$QT_PATH/bitcoin-qt -datadir=$DATA_DIR
```

---

## Testing the GUI

We'll start off with a very simple test to ensure the GUI properly runs and that we're able to do some basic wallet operations. First, create a fresh datadir and launch `bitcoin-qt` on signet:

```shell
rm -r $DATA_DIR
mkdir $DATA_DIR
$QT_PATH/bitcoin-qt -datadir=$DATA_DIR -signet
```

_If you're unable to launch the GUI from cli, see [this guide](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24501#issuecomment-1081463097) on how to switch to signet from within the GUI._

Since you're starting from a fresh datadir, the first thing you should see is the progress screen of Initial Block Download (IBD). You can simply hide it at the bottom right and proceed to the main interface.

There should be no existing wallets yet, so click "Create a new wallet". Since [#23002](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23002), the new wallet should default to a [descriptor wallet](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/99541/129640). Create the wallet as per your preferred settings, feel free to experiment.

If IBD has completed (this process is relatively quick on signet), you can get some free corn from one of the signet faucets available, e.g. [https://signet.bublina.eu.org/](https://signet.bublina.eu.org/). Generate a fresh address on the "Receive" tab, pop it into the faucet, and watch signet coins flow into your newly generated (and probably soon destroyed) descriptor wallet. Good stuff.

Test completed, well done! Feel free to continue testing the GUI in any way you like, and don't forget to clean up your datadir and stop your node when you're finished.


## Testing Non-Default Ports

*For brevity, in this section "(non-)default" refers to "listening on (non-)default ports. For example, a non-default peer is a peer that is not listening on :8333".*

Before 23.0, Bitcoin Core had a strong preference to try to connect only to peers that listen on port 8333. As a result of that, Bitcoin nodes listening on non-standard ports would likely not get any Bitcoin Core peers connecting to them. This preference has been removed in [#23542](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23542).

We will test this by verifying that a non-default outbound peer is automatically established within a reasonable amount of time. Since there is a lot of randomness involved in how [AddrMan](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/Addrman-and-eclipse-attacks#the-address-manager-in-bitcoin-core) selects a new address to connect to, it is difficult to predict how long this test will take. To give some insight, we also provide a monitoring script that shows how many non-default connections (including failed attempts) have been made, and we compare it with how many non-default addresses are in AddrMan.

It is quite straightforward to do this test visually with bitcoin-qt, but in this guide we'll document how you can do this with the cli using a provided script, which works as follows:

1. Start `bitcoind` from a fresh datadir, and include net debug logging so our logs include connection attempts
1. After `bitcoind` is running, we wait until our peers have provided us with sufficient (5000) addresses to connect to
1. Once we have enough addresses, every 5 seconds we disconnect all default peers so we have room to automatically try new connections to hopefully non-default peers
1. Once a non-default peer is detected, the script halts and the test is successful

```shell
rm -r $DATA_DIR
mkdir $DATA_DIR
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoind -datadir=$DATA_DIR -daemonwait -debug=net

MINADDRCOUNT=5000
DISCONNECTFREQ=5

getNonDefaultNode() {
  echo $($BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR getpeerinfo) | jq 'map(select(.inbound == false and (.addr | endswith(":8333")|not)))[0]'
}

echo "bitcoind started, waiting until we have $MINADDRCOUNT addresses in AddrMan..."
ADDRCOUNT=0
while [[ "$ADDRCOUNT" -le $MINADDRCOUNT ]];do

    if [[ "$(getNonDefaultNode)" != "null" ]]; then break; fi
    ADDRCOUNT=$($BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR getnodeaddresses 0 | jq 'length')
    sleep 1
done

echo "Starting test, disconnecting outbound peers on :8333 every $DISCONNECTFREQ seconds..."
until [[ "$(getNonDefaultNode)" != "null" ]] > /dev/null;
do $BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR getpeerinfo | jq 'map(select(.inbound == false and (.addr | endswith(":8333")))) | .[] | .id' | xargs -L 1 $BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR disconnectnode "" > /dev/null
sleep $DISCONNECTFREQ;
done;

echo "Test successful: connected to non-default peer on $(getNonDefaultNode | jq '.addr')"
```

You can monitor progress with the below script which refreshes every 2 seconds. At the top, you can see the currently connected outbound peers. Underneath are some stats based on `debug.log` that show how many connection attempts have been made as well as statistics on AddrMan's composition of default vs non-default addresses.

If the AddrMan ratio is 5%, it means that our (local) view of the network is that 5% of nodes are non-default, and thus that 5% of outbound connections should be to non-default nodes. It does not necessarily mean 5% of our peers are non-default, since e.g. there could be biases like non-default nodes being less reliable than default nodes.

While everyone's AddrMan database is different and the number of non-default nodes can change over time, it is at the time of writing reasonable to expect a non-defaultness ratio of around 3-10%.

**You should open this monitoring script in a new session, make sure to set your $DATA_DIR variable again.**

```shell
cat > $DATA_DIR/connection_monitoring.sh << 'EOF'
echo "Currently connected outbound peers:"
echo "id   address"
echo "$($BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR getpeerinfo | jq -r 'select(map(.inbound == false)) | .[] | [.id, .addr] | @tsv')"

CONNECTNONDEF=$(grep "trying connection" $DATA_DIR/debug.log | grep -v ':8333 ' -c)
CONNECTTOTAL=$(grep "trying connection" $DATA_DIR/debug.log -c)
CONNECTRATIO=$(echo "scale=2; $CONNECTNONDEF * 100 / $CONNECTTOTAL" | bc -l)

$BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR getnodeaddresses 0 > $DATA_DIR/getnodeaddresses0
ADDRMANNONDEF=$(cat $DATA_DIR/getnodeaddresses0 |jq 'map(select(.port != 8333)) |length')
ADDRMANTOTAL=$(cat $DATA_DIR/getnodeaddresses0 |jq 'length')
ADDRMANRATIO=$(echo "scale=2; $ADDRMANNONDEF * 100 / $ADDRMANTOTAL" | bc -l)

echo "\nConnection stats:"
echo "                        non-default   total   ratio"
echo "Connection attempts:    $CONNECTNONDEF              $CONNECTTOTAL     $CONNECTRATIO%"
echo "AddrMan entries:        $ADDRMANNONDEF           $ADDRMANTOTAL    $ADDRMANRATIO%"
EOF
chmod +x $DATA_DIR/connection_monitoring.sh

watch $DATA_DIR/connection_monitoring.sh
```

Once the test is successful, don't forget to stop your node and clean the datadir.


## Testing CJDNS

[#23077](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23077) added full support for CJDNS, in addition to IPv4, IPv6, Tor and I2P.

Additional network support improves Bitcoin's censorship resistance and helps the network resist eclipse attacks. If this is your first time hearing about CJDNS, check out the project's [whitepaper](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/doc/Whitepaper.md).

We are going to test that your node can find and connect to other CJDNS nodes. It should be noted that we are restricting our node to CJDNS for testing purposes. It is not recommended to limit to CJDNS in real-world use as the node count on CJDNS is still very low.


### Installing CJDNS

*Note: building CJDNS on Windows currently does not seem to be supported.*

For a brief overview of CJDNS and installation instructions, see the documentation in [doc/cjdns.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/cjdns.md). Instead of searching for friends, it is probably quicker to use the public nodes from [https://github.com/hyperboria/peers/](https://github.com/hyperboria/peers/).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hyperboria/peers/ hyperboria-peers
cd hyperboria-peers
./testAvailable.py
```

Select some of the IP addresses that return the green message "addr... is ok", and find the corresponding full config in `/hyperboria-peers/<continent/<country>/...` folder and then add them to your `cjdroute.conf` file. Note that there are two `connectTo` entries in the config, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6. Make sure to put each peer in the correct category.

Once `cjdroute` is fully up and running, make sure you're able to connect to another peer over CJDNS by pinging them, for example:

```shell
ping6 fc32:17ea:e415:c3bf:9808:149d:b5a2:c9aa
```

### Running the test

Start from a clean datadir, and then create a `$DATA_DIR/bitcoin.conf` file with the below lines
```shell
cjdnsreachable=1
onlynet=cjdns

# Uncomment this if you'd like other nodes to be able to connect to you too
# listen=1

addnode=[fc32:17ea:e415:c3bf:9808:149d:b5a2:c9aa]:8333
addnode=[fcc7:be49:ccd1:dc91:3125:f0da:457d:8ce]:8333
addnode=[fc68:7026:cb27:b014:5910:e609:dcdb:22a2]:8333
```

Now start your node. Usage of CJDNS is still limited so there aren't many nodes yet. We can look at the netinfo dashboard with the below command:

```shell
watch $BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR -netinfo 4
```

You should eventually see connected peers, which means you are successfully running over CJDNS! Make sure to stop and wipe your data directory before moving on to the next section. The result should look something like the below:

```
<->   type   net  mping   ping send recv  txn  blk  hb addrp addrl  age id address                                        version
cjdnsreachable=1
out manual cjdns    217   5871   27   67                1006          5  2 [fcc7:be49:ccd1:dc91:3125:f0da:457d:8ce]:8333  70016/Satoshi:23.99.0/
out manual cjdns   1141   3099    2    1                1012          6  1 [fc68:7026:cb27:b014:5910:e609:dcdb:22a2]:8333 70016/Satoshi:22.99.0/
out manual cjdns   1917   4148    7   26                1001          6  0 [fc32:17ea:e415:c3bf:9808:149d:b5a2:c9aa]:8333 70016/Satoshi:23.99.0(@jon)/
```

Once the test is successful, don't forget to stop your node and clean the datadir.


### Further performance testing

Beyond ensuring that Bitcoin Core is able to connect over just CJDNS at all as per the previous test, we also need to verify that different combinations of networks work fine (for example, see [#24450](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24450)), and how those combinations perform - especially during Initial Block Download (IBD).

The exact instructions are beyond the scope of this guide, but it would be much appreciated if you're able to run (part of) an IBD twice, once with each of the below settings:

1. CJDNS only (`-cjdnsreachable=1 -onlynet=cjdns`)
1. CJDNS and Tor only (`-cjdnsreachable=1 -onlynet=cjdns -onlynet=onion`)

For instructions on using Tor, please refer to [doc/tor.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/tor.md). Please report your findings about (in)compatibility and performance on [#24555](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24555).


## Testing arm64-apple-darwin binaries

This new version introduces native binaries for `arm64-apple-darwin`, also referred to as Apple Silicon or M1 chips. Even though this does not introduce any new functionality, issues in the build process could lead to unexpected bugs for users on this platform. This guide includes two basic tests to get you started and to ensure the binaries properly boot, but you are encouraged to test all functionality of the software (and especially your usual workflows and configs), whether that is with `bitcoin-cli` or `bitcoin-qt`.


### Getting started

*This test is specifically for people working on the `arm64-apple-darwin` platform, i.e. users with a M1 Macbook Pro/Macbook Air/iMac/Mac Mini.*

Even though you may have compiled from source for the previous tests, you now need to use the [precompiled binaries](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-23.0/test.rc3/bitcoin-23.0rc3-arm64-apple-darwin.tar.gz). Make sure to update your `$BINARY_PATH` to reflect this new path, for example:

```shell
export BINARY_PATH=~/Downloads/bitcoin-23.0rc3/bin/
```

In macOS 11 on Macs with Apple silicon, and starting in macOS Big Sur 11 beta 6, the operating system [enforces](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-big-sur-11_0_1-universal-apps-release-notes) that any executable must be signed before it’s allowed to run. This is a very simple process:

```shell
codesign --sign - $BINARY_PATH/*
```

Due to macOS security settings, you are likely to be unable to execute any of the downloaded binaries from the terminal before you have manually marked them as trusted. To do so, run the below command to remove quarantine flags or navigate to your `$BINARY_DIR` in Finder, and launch each of the 3 binaries (`bitcoind`, `bitcoin-qt`, `bitcoin-cli`) by right-clicking, and then selecting "Open" twice. Afterwards, you should be able to execute them from the terminal as usual.

```shell
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine $BINARY_PATH
```


### IBD test

For this first basic test, we'll just verify that we can get Initial Block Download (IBD) to work. As always, make sure to use a fresh datadir and then start `bitcoind`.

```shell
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoind -datadir=$DATA_DIR -daemonwait
watch $BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR -getinfo
```

After a while, you should see `"verificationprogress"` and `"blocks"` increasing. This indicates IBD is running normally and the test is successful.


### Wallet test

We've already introduced the [simple GUI wallet test](#testing-the-gui) in the beginning of this guide. Please revisit this test, but now use the precompiled binaries instead. Make sure to update $QT_PATH to point to the freshly downloaded binaries folder (this should be the same as $BINARY_PATH). As this is a newly supported platform, as many paths as possible should be tested, so you're strongly encouraged to play around with the GUI and try to break things.


### Further testing

The two previous basic tests just indicate that the binaries boot normally and that some basic functionality is working, but there could be various other bugs or problems that are unique to the `arm64-apple-darwin`. Please test your usual workflows and configs to ensure they work as expected. To avoid loss of funds or other issues on mainnet, you can safely test on `-signet`.

Once you're finished testing, don't forget to stop your node and clean the datadir.


## SHA256 implementation test
[#24115](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24115) improves SHA256 performance on ARMv8 architecture, which includes Apple M1 chips. If you are on the ARMv8 architecture you should verify that support for this optimization is properly recognized. Create a fresh datadir, start bitcoind and ensure that the output of the next 2 commands matches what you see.

```
$ sysctl -a | grep hw.optional.arm.FEAT_SHA256

hw.optional.arm.FEAT_SHA256: 1
```

```
$ grep "SHA256 implementation" $DATA_DIR/debug.log

2022-04-02T10:31:53Z Using the 'arm_shani(1way,2way)' SHA256 implementation
```

If you see any other output, such as "Using the 'standard' SHA256 implementation", please raise it on the [v23.0 testing issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/24501).

Once you're finished testing, don't forget to stop your node and clean the datadir.
