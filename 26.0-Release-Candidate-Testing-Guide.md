# Testing Guide: Bitcoin Core 26.0 Release Candidate

_For feedback on this guide, please visit [#2xxxx](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/)_

This document outlines some of the upcoming Bitcoin Core 26.0 release changes and provides steps to help test them. This guide is meant to be the starting point for experimentation and further testing, but is in no way comprehensive! After running through the steps in this guide, you are encouraged to do your own testing.

This can be as simple as testing the same features in this guide but trying it a different way. Even better, think of features you use regularly and test that they still work as expected in the release candidate. You can also read the [release notes][release notes] to find something not covered in this guide. **This is a great way to be involved with Bitcoin's development and helps keep Bitcoin running smoothly and bug-free! Your help in this endeavour is greatly appreciated.**

## Preparation

### 1. Grab Latest Release Candidate

**Current Release Candidate:** [Bitcoin Core 26.0rc2][source-code] ([release-notes][release notes])

There are two ways to grab the latest release candidate: pre-compiled binary or source code. The source code for the latest release can be grabbed from here: [latest release source code][source-code]
      
If you want to use a binary, make sure to [grab the correct one for your system][binaries].

[source-code]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v26.0rc2
[binaries]: https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-26.0/test.rc2/
[release notes]: https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/26.0-Release-Notes-Draft

### 2. Compile Release Candidate

**If you grabbed a binary, skip this step**

Before compiling, make sure that your system has all the right [dependencies][dependencies] installed. Since descriptor wallets are now the default, it is recommended that you **compile with sqlite**(`--with-sqlite=yes`), so make sure you have installed the `sqlite3` dependency.

For more information on compiling from source, here are some guides to compile Bitcoin Core for [UNIX/Linux](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md), [macOS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md), [Windows](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md), [FreeBSD](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-freebsd.md), [NetBSD](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-netbsd.md), and [OpenBSD](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-openbsd.md).

[dependencies]: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dependencies.md

### 3. Setting up command line environment

First, create a temporary data directory
```shell
export DATA_DIR=/tmp/26-rc-test
mkdir $DATA_DIR
```

Next, specify the following paths. For source compiled, start from the root of your release candidate directory and run:

```shell
export BINARY_PATH=$(pwd)/src
```

For the downloaded binary, start from the root of the downloaded release candidate (cd ~/bitcoin-26.0rc2, for example) and run:
```shell
export BINARY_PATH=$(pwd)/bin
```

To avoid specifying the data directory (`-datadir=$DATA_DIR`) on each command, below are a few extra variables to set.
```shell
alias bitcoind-test="$(echo $BINARY_PATH)/bitcoind -datadir=$DATA_DIR"
alias bcli="$(echo $BINARY_PATH)/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR"
```

The commands throughout the rest of the guide will look like:

```shell
bcli [cli args]
```

**Start node**
```shell
echo "regtest=1" >> $DATA_DIR/bitcoin.conf
```
```shell
 bitcoind-test
```

```shell
2023-11-05T13:42:54Z Bitcoin Core version v26.0rc2 (release build)

2023-11-05T13:42:54Z Config file: /tmp/26-rc-test/bitcoin.conf (not found, skipping)
```
Stop the daemon
```shell
Ctrl + C
```
Look at the logs and ensure you are running the correct version.


### 4. Reset testing environment

Between sections in this guide, it's recommended to stop your node and wipe the data directory. You can use the commands provided below.

**Stop node**
```shell
bcli stop
```

**Wipe and recreate the directory**
```shell
rm -r $DATA_DIR
mkdir $DATA_DIR
```

***

## RPC: add getprioritisedtransactions

The RPC `prioritisetransaction` allows you to "prioritise" a transaction in the mempool by treating it as if it had a higher fee than it actually does. This new RPC allows you to see which transactions have been prioritised and if they are in your mempool.

Before beginning make sure you have already [stopped your node and cleaned the datadir](#4-reset-testing-environment).

We can test this RPC on regtest:

```shell
echo "regtest=1" >> $DATA_DIR/bitcoin.conf
bitcoind-test -daemon
```

Let's create a wallet

```shell
bcli createwallet test-wallet
```

```shell
{
  "name": "test-wallet"
}
```

And generate some blocks so that we have some funds

```shell
bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet -generate 101
```

Get an address

```shell
export ADDRESS=$(bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet getnewaddress)
```

Send a transaction to yourself with a 10 sat per vbyte fee

```shell
bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet send "{\"$ADDRESS\": 1}" null "unset" 10
```

```shell
{
  "txid": "2f22473070db30ab29b16a17f31d1fedd07c018639752430c2f265641c277149",
  "complete": true
}
```

Let's prioritise this transaction and give it a boost of another 10 sats per vbyte

```shell
bcli prioritisetransaction <txid from tx above> 0 10
```

And finally call the getprioritisedtransactions RPC to see that it's prioritised, what the fee delta is and if it's in the mempool.

```shell
bcli getprioritisedtransactions
```

```shell
{
  "2f22473070db30ab29b16a17f31d1fedd07c018639752430c2f265641c277149": {
    "fee_delta": 10,
    "in_mempool": true
  }
}
```

Once the test is successful, don't forget to [stop your node and clean the datadir](#4-reset-testing-environment).


***

## RPC: Importmempool

A new RPC is available to import a mempool.dat file without having to restart the node.

Before beginning make sure you have already [stopped your node and cleaned the datadir](#4-reset-testing-environment).

This change allows for import of a mempool.dat file using an RPC which previously had to be put in a specific directory when starting bitcoind. To test this, we will run two bitcoinds on regtest initially connected and then disconnect them and move a mempool over manually.

To support running two bitcoinds we will need to add a few extra variables and aliases into our shell.

```shell
mkdir ${DATA_DIR}2
alias bitcoind-test2="$(echo $BINARY_PATH)/bitcoind -datadir=${DATA_DIR}2"
alias bcli2="$(echo $BINARY_PATH)/bitcoin-cli -datadir=${DATA_DIR}2"
```

Configure the first bitcoind

```shell
echo "regtest=1" >> $DATA_DIR/bitcoin.conf
```

Configure the second bitcoind (on different ports to prevent port conflict on the host)

```shell
echo "regtest=1" >> ${DATA_DIR}2/bitcoin.conf
echo "[regtest]" >> ${DATA_DIR}2/bitcoin.conf
echo "port=12340" >> ${DATA_DIR}2/bitcoin.conf
echo "rpcport=10340" >> ${DATA_DIR}2/bitcoin.conf
```

Start both bitcoinds

```shell
bitcoind-test -daemon
bitcoind-test2 -daemon
```

Connect the two nodes together

```shell
bcli addnode localhost:12340 add
```

Check they are connected

```shell
bcli getpeerinfo
```

```shell
[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "addr": "localhost:12340",
    "addrbind": "127.0.0.1:63880",
    "network": "not_publicly_routable",
    ...
    "connection_type": "manual",
    "transport_protocol_type": "v1",
    "session_id": ""
  }
]
```

Create a wallet

```shell
bcli createwallet test-wallet
```

```shell
{
  "name": "test-wallet"
}
```

Generate some blocks

```shell
bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet -generate 101
```

Check both nodes saw the blocks

```shell
bcli -getinfo
bcli2 -getinfo
```

```shell
Chain: regtest
Blocks: 101
Headers: 101
Verification progress: 100.0000%
...
```

Let's disconnect the nodes

```shell
bcli addnode localhost:12340 remove
bcli disconnectnode localhost:12340
```

Check they have been disconnected. Note, this can take a few seconds. Retry check until it's confirmed they are no longer connected.

```shell
bcli getpeerinfo
```

```shell
[
]
```

Get an address from the test wallet on the first bitcoind

```shell
export ADDRESS=$(bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet getnewaddress)
```

Send a transaction on the first bitcoind, leave it as unconfirmed

```shell
bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet send "{\"$ADDRESS\": 1}" null "unset" 10
```

Check mempool on the first bitcoind, we should see one transaction

```shell
bcli getmempoolinfo
```

```shell
{
  "loaded": true,
  "size": 1,
  "bytes": 141,
  "usage": 1136,
  "total_fee": 0.00001410,
  "maxmempool": 300000000,
  "mempoolminfee": 0.00001000,
  "minrelaytxfee": 0.00001000,
  "incrementalrelayfee": 0.00001000,
  "unbroadcastcount": 1,
  "fullrbf": false
}
```

And because the two nodes are now disconnected, the second node won't have this in it's mempool

```shell
bcli2 getmempoolinfo
```

```shell
{
  "loaded": true,
  "size": 0,
  "bytes": 0,
  "usage": 0,
  "total_fee": 0.00000000,
  "maxmempool": 300000000,
  "mempoolminfee": 0.00001000,
  "minrelaytxfee": 0.00001000,
  "incrementalrelayfee": 0.00001000,
  "unbroadcastcount": 0,
  "fullrbf": false
}
```

Let's export the mempool from the first bitcoind

```shell
bcli savemempool
```

```shell
{
  "filename": "/tmp/26-rc-test/regtest/mempool.dat"
}
```

And import it on the second bitcoind

```shell
bcli2 importmempool /tmp/26-rc-test/regtest/mempool.dat
```

Now we should see that the mempool on the second node has this one transaction in it

```shell
bcli2 getmempoolinfo
```

```shell
{
  "loaded": true,
  "size": 1,
  "bytes": 141,
  "usage": 1136,
  "total_fee": 0.00001410,
  "maxmempool": 300000000,
  "mempoolminfee": 0.00001000,
  "minrelaytxfee": 0.00001000,
  "incrementalrelayfee": 0.00001000,
  "unbroadcastcount": 0,
  "fullrbf": false
}
```

For this test we need to not only [cleanup the original datadir](#4-reset-testing-environment) but also we need to cleanup the second one:

```shell
bcli2 stop
rm -r ${DATA_DIR}2
```

***

## V2 Transport - BIP 324

V2 transport if supported by both sides of a connection encrypts peer traffic. In this guide, we will test this on signet by connecting to nodes that are known to support V2 transport but please feel free to run this on a different network.

Before beginning make sure you have already [stopped your node and cleaned the datadir](#4-reset-testing-environment).

Add `signet=1` and `v2transport=1` in the bitcoin.conf to use the signet network for testing.

```shell
echo "signet=1" >> $DATA_DIR/bitcoin.conf
echo "v2transport=1" >> $DATA_DIR/bitcoin.conf
```

```shell
bitcoind-test -daemon
```

Connect to a signet node supporting V2. Two nodes on signet that should support V2 Transport are: 

* `bitcoin.achow101.com:38333`
* `175.45.182.145:38333`.

```shell
bcli addnode <node ip or hostname>:38333 add true
```

The `true` at end of the previous command instructs the addnode RPC to us V2 transport.

Check that you have successfully connected using V2 Transport:

```shell
bcli getpeerinfo
```

```shell
[
  ...
  {
    "id": 15,
    "addr": "bitcoin.achow101.com:38333",
    ...
    "connection_type": "manual",
    "transport_protocol_type": "v2",
    "session_id": "7c081213779063150191fe0295da0dd18d95c9b4dc67809cc4ed9fb9e112ca71"
  }
]
```

This successfully tested manual v2 connections. To see more logging consider enabling net logging with:

```shell
bcli logging "[\"net\"]"
```

To view anything related to V2 Transport the logs:

```shell
cat $DATA_DIR/signet/debug.log | grep v2
```

Please check to see if you have also connected to an automatic v2 peer which is one that you didn't explicitly try to connect but your node would have become aware of via gossip.

Once the test is successful, don't forget to [stop your node and clean the datadir](#4-reset-testing-environment).

***

## TapMiniscript

[Miniscript](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/miniscript/) is now supported inside a taproot descriptor. To test, we will use a simple miniscript using fragment `or_b` which allows one of two keys to be used to spend.

Before beginning make sure you have already [stopped your node and cleaned the datadir](#4-reset-testing-environment).

We can run this test on regtest:

```shell
echo "regtest=1" >> $DATA_DIR/bitcoin.conf
```

```shell
bitcoind-test -daemon
```

Create two wallets

```shell
bcli -named createwallet wallet_name=taproot-wallet blank=true descriptors=true
bcli createwallet legacy-wallet
```

To use this feature we will use a taproot + miniscript descriptor:

`tr(<Taproot Internal Key>,or_b(pk(<key A>/*),s:pk(<key B>/*)))`

Breaking down this descriptor we can see that it uses `tr()` to denote it's taproot, it has one script leaf which uses the miniscript fragment `or_b` which means one of two keys will be provided.

Take a look at [https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/) to learn about other valid miniscript fragments and scripts.

If we use the following keys:

* `Internal Key: tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPerQj6m35no46amfKQdjY7AhLnmatHYXs8S4MTgeZYkWAn4edSGwwL3vkSiiGqSZQrmy5D3P5gBoqgvYP2fCUpBwbKTMTAkL`
* `Key A: tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPd3cbrKjE5GKKJLDEidhtzSSmPVtSPyoHQGL2LZw49yt9foZsN9BeiC5VqRaESUSDV2PS9w7zAVBSK6EQH3CZW9sMKxSKDwD`
* `Key B: tprv8iF7W37EHnVEtDr9EFeyFjQJFL6SfGby2AnZ2vQARxTQHQXy9tdzZvBBVp8a19e5vXhskczLkJ1AZjqgScqWL4FpmXVp8LLjiorcrFK63Sr`

The full descriptor becomes:

`tr(tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPerQj6m35no46amfKQdjY7AhLnmatHYXs8S4MTgeZYkWAn4edSGwwL3vkSiiGqSZQrmy5D3P5gBoqgvYP2fCUpBwbKTMTAkL,or_b(pk(tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPd3cbrKjE5GKKJLDEidhtzSSmPVtSPyoHQGL2LZw49yt9foZsN9BeiC5VqRaESUSDV2PS9w7zAVBSK6EQH3CZW9sMKxSKDwD/*),s:pk(tprv8iF7W37EHnVEtDr9EFeyFjQJFL6SfGby2AnZ2vQARxTQHQXy9tdzZvBBVp8a19e5vXhskczLkJ1AZjqgScqWL4FpmXVp8LLjiorcrFK63Sr/*)))`

Lets work out the checksum for this descriptor:

```shell
bcli getdescriptorinfo "tr(tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPerQj6m35no46amfKQdjY7AhLnmatHYXs8S4MTgeZYkWAn4edSGwwL3vkSiiGqSZQrmy5D3P5gBoqgvYP2fCUpBwbKTMTAkL,or_b(pk(tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPd3cbrKjE5GKKJLDEidhtzSSmPVtSPyoHQGL2LZw49yt9foZsN9BeiC5VqRaESUSDV2PS9w7zAVBSK6EQH3CZW9sMKxSKDwD/*),s:pk(tprv8iF7W37EHnVEtDr9EFeyFjQJFL6SfGby2AnZ2vQARxTQHQXy9tdzZvBBVp8a19e5vXhskczLkJ1AZjqgScqWL4FpmXVp8LLjiorcrFK63Sr/*)))"
```

```shell
{
  "descriptor": "tr(tpubD6NzVbkrYhZ4YKSWzQhgCCiD9oBFZxvSgUJ85HdBhpLFxvK865U9jF82xCoBAn9nwNZ4uwX7ZKhZbh2iZRPa5s3UHXg3v7d1srFY44SFJVt,or_b(pk(tpubD6NzVbkrYhZ4WWePjyPpUfyRsMjAsxtoZk3Yg1vjpFbgEkanxxkeLUW1qw7Q8k1n9asHy7yC9fJtQmYhAZLFvFr2iYUa2Lv8YWgtcPahTow/*),s:pk(tpubDEw9eT9USAAumgsw7uKZf94QpMcNpbnsbUPLKSSTrEFo7tnjnHTakQo3fxhoD41o5Lq25J64D4DYjPQZMPmVa5xvNX8qP1z19uMPRaGd9Uc/*)))#a78h9fyu",
  "checksum": "sek2wh9v",
  "isrange": true,
  "issolvable": true,
  "hasprivatekeys": true
}
```

And import the descriptor into our wallet named taproot-wallet

```shell
bcli -rpcwallet=taproot-wallet importdescriptors '[{"desc": "tr(tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPerQj6m35no46amfKQdjY7AhLnmatHYXs8S4MTgeZYkWAn4edSGwwL3vkSiiGqSZQrmy5D3P5gBoqgvYP2fCUpBwbKTMTAkL,or_b(pk(tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPd3cbrKjE5GKKJLDEidhtzSSmPVtSPyoHQGL2LZw49yt9foZsN9BeiC5VqRaESUSDV2PS9w7zAVBSK6EQH3CZW9sMKxSKDwD/*),s:pk(tprv8iF7W37EHnVEtDr9EFeyFjQJFL6SfGby2AnZ2vQARxTQHQXy9tdzZvBBVp8a19e5vXhskczLkJ1AZjqgScqWL4FpmXVp8LLjiorcrFK63Sr/*)))#sek2wh9v","timestamp": "now","active":true,"internal": true, "next": 0}]'
```

Next we can give this wallet some funds by generating blocks and then try and spend back to our wallet named `legacy-wallet`.

Get an address:

```shell
bcli deriveaddresses "tr(tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPerQj6m35no46amfKQdjY7AhLnmatHYXs8S4MTgeZYkWAn4edSGwwL3vkSiiGqSZQrmy5D3P5gBoqgvYP2fCUpBwbKTMTAkL,or_b(pk(tprv8ZgxMBicQKsPd3cbrKjE5GKKJLDEidhtzSSmPVtSPyoHQGL2LZw49yt9foZsN9BeiC5VqRaESUSDV2PS9w7zAVBSK6EQH3CZW9sMKxSKDwD/*),s:pk(tprv8iF7W37EHnVEtDr9EFeyFjQJFL6SfGby2AnZ2vQARxTQHQXy9tdzZvBBVp8a19e5vXhskczLkJ1AZjqgScqWL4FpmXVp8LLjiorcrFK63Sr/*)))#sek2wh9v" "[0,0]"
```
```shell
[
  "bcrt1pysnlw6me7prca487trt305dzymxzhkknj834j320cq2krrzl4g8se36kq5"
]
```

Generate a block to this address:
```shell
bcli generatetoaddress 1 bcrt1pysnlw6me7prca487trt305dzymxzhkknj834j320cq2krrzl4g8se36kq5
```

Then generate 100 other blocks:
```shell
bcli -rpcwallet=legacy-wallet -generate 100
```

Now we should be able to see that our taproot wallet has a UTXO ready to be spent:

```shell
bcli -rpcwallet=taproot-wallet listunspent
```
```shell
[
  {
    "txid": "92d4cdf376db2a3b1315d7e9b39700b6ad43b731014b2e0fcea342d7f6e07be3",

    ],
    "safe": true
  }
]
```

To spend this, lets construct a payment using that output to a new address.

First get a new address to send funds to:

```shell
export ADDRESS=$(bcli -rpcwallet=legacy-wallet getnewaddress)
```

Send 49.9BTC to this address

```shell
bcli -rpcwallet=taproot-wallet send "{\"$ADDRESS\": 49.9}" null "unset" 1.1
```
```shell
{
  "txid": "385504b1379770e6b3b8da1e07faf81cd36cd066f84fac33f14b61367608cd2e",
  "complete": true
}
```

Mine a block

```shell
bcli -rpcwallet=legacy-wallet -generate 1
```
```shell
{
  "address": "bcrt1qygad7v49uql5kgqpp6navxxj2g2pw34w0g6n0d",
  "blocks": [
    "15bf3c15480ed033c993c9dda85c9fdc84e4cec0ca9cc1bd191c9fa112a1332a"
  ]
}
```

Check our transaction id returned from the send command is in the block:

```shell

The tooling around TapMiniScript is a little limited at the moment but some ideas on how to take this further could be:

1) Try more complex miniscript scripts
2) Implement a 2of2 between a Coldcard and a Ledger which decays into a 1 of 2 after -say- 6 blocks (be cautious with real funds)

Once the test is successful, don't forget to [stop your node and clean the datadir](#4-reset-testing-environment).

## MacOs zip packaging

This one should be relatively straightforward to test if you are on MacOS.

Either:

1) [Compile from source](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md) on a mac

Or 

2) Download [MacOs Zip](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-26.0/test.rc2/) from bitcoincore.org

It should be possible to extract the Bitcoin application, drag it to the Applications directory and run it. For the first run you may need to right click the application and click run to give MacOS permissions to run the downloaded app.

Remember to shut bitcoin down as it will start running the initial block download on mainnet if you haven't configured a config file instructing it to do otherwise.

## Ancestor Aware Funding

Transactions that use unconfirmed UTXOs as their input will now calculate the effective fee for all the transactions together and increase the fee on the child transaction to hit the desired fee.

Before beginning make sure you have already [stopped your node and cleaned the datadir](#4-reset-testing-environment).

Run on regtest:

```shell
echo "regtest=1" >> $DATA_DIR/bitcoin.conf
```

```shell
bitcoind-test -daemon
```

Create a wallet

```shell
bcli createwallet test-wallet
```
```shell
{
  "name": "test-wallet"
}
```

Mine yourself some block rewards

```shell
bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet -generate 1
```

Make another wallet to mine to to get previous transaction confirmed

```shell
bcli createwallet another-wallet
```
```shell
{
  "name": "another-wallet"
}
```
```shell
bcli -rpcwallet=another-wallet -generate 100
```

Create an address with test wallet

```shell
export ADDRESS=$(bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet getnewaddress)
```

Send a 1BTC, 10 sat per vbyte transaction to yourself using your 50btc block reward

```shell
 bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet send "{\"$ADDRESS\": 1}" null "unset" 10
```

This transaction will remain unconfirmed unless we mine a block (which we wont)

Get another address:

```shell
export ADDRESS=$(bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet getnewaddress)
```

Now send a 2BTC, 20 sat per vbyte transaction to yourself

```shell
 bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet send "{\"$ADDRESS\": 2}" null "unset" 20
```

As this second transaction will use the original 1BTC, 10 sat per vbyte transaction's output it would require both transactions to be included in a block. The PR tries to ensure that this child transaction is aware of that ancestor and sets it's fee sufficiently high so that when you average both transactions' fees out they hit your new target (20 sats per vbyte in this case).

Let's look at the transactions on this test wallet and their fees:

```shell
bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet listtransactions
```
```shell
[
  {
    ...
    "category": "generate",
    "amount": 50.00000000,
    "label": "",
    "vout": 0,
    "abandoned": false,
    "confirmations": 101,
    "generated": true,
    ...
  },
  ...
  {
    "address": "bcrt1qwqnjhrp535gxul8rry2jg4xv4rq26ptlg9xqkg",
    "category": "send",
    "amount": -1.00000000,
    "label": "",
    "vout": 1,
    "fee": -0.00001410,
    "confirmations": 0,
    "trusted": true,
    "txid": "3c6f4e09becd0ba3c586535b6e3abdafd766c0e2fc1df5f24c162c60a88dc3e9",
    "wtxid": "de4b240151e07120cae459e40e24b6b2d71d11bd769e6a698741c1b23ce9cf96",
    ...
  },
  ...
  {
    "address": "bcrt1qzwd6gz6dvu6yeh9cl6vdky4a2qszrmlymkugp5",
    "category": "send",
    "amount": -2.00000000,
    "label": "",
    "vout": 0,
    "fee": -0.00004230,
    "confirmations": 0,
    "trusted": true,
    "txid": "3b22b7c7e78f4369177109437bbafe0be47393a12b637c1ac506fa9283fd774e",
    "wtxid": "050e8332d302578cf0c3f3019454d4ab921aeed36ff6ba498b52ad6b2c60b7eb",
    ...
  }
]
```

Pay attention to the fees paid. The fee on the first transaction was 1410 sats and the fee on the second was 4230. If we add these two fees together we get 5640 sats but that's obviously paying for two transactions. So if we assume equal weight and divide by two we get an average of 2820 paid per tx. This is double the 1410 sats we paid when we asked for 10 sats a vbyte. So the average across both appears to be 20 sats per vbyte as requested by our second transaction.

This test only used one ancestor but automatic bumping should affect all ancestor transactions. Try to make one or two more transactions at a different feerate and consider which transactions were bumped or not bumped.

Once the test is successful, don't forget to [stop your node and clean the datadir](#4-reset-testing-environment).

## Outbound connection management

The motivation behind this PR is to try to maintain at least one connection per network type (IPV4/6, tor, I2P, CJDNS).

Before beginning make sure you have already [stopped your node and cleaned the datadir](#4-reset-testing-environment).

How to test this improvement:

1) Run on mainnet
2) Configure multiple networks (IP4/6, tor, I2P, CJDNS)
3) Observe that node connects to at least one peer in all of these networks
4) As you are on mainnet remember to shutdown bitcoind when you are finished

The problem with the above test is that it is entirely possible you would have had connections to all of those networks by chance. We can't prove the PR helped in this regard. It is beyond the scope of this testing document but one idea for how we could try to have more confidence that the PR is working is to setup a contrived network, perhaps using the [Warnet](https://github.com/bitcoin-dev-project/warnet) tool.

Alternative testing idea using warnet

1) Run warnet with hundreds of IPV4 nodes and a handful of tor/i2p/cjdns nodes
2) Observe that the multi network nodes all find and connect with each other

The idea is that before the PR a multi network node would be happy just connecting to the plentiful IPV4 nodes.

Once the test is successful, don't forget to [stop your node and clean the datadir](#4-reset-testing-environment).
