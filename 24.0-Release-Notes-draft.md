24.0 Release Notes Draft
===============================

Bitcoin Core version *version* is now available from:

  <https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-*version*/>

This release includes new features, various bug fixes and performance
improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems
using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin
Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as
frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on
unsupported systems.

Notable changes
===============

P2P and network changes
-----------------------

- With I2P connections, a new, transient address is used for each outbound
  connection if `-i2pacceptincoming=0`. (#25355)

Updated RPCs
------------

- The `-deprecatedrpc=softforks` configuration option has been removed.  The
  RPC `getblockchaininfo` no longer returns the `softforks` field, which was
  previously deprecated in 23.0. (#23508) Information on soft fork status is
  now only available via the `getdeploymentinfo` RPC.

- The `deprecatedrpc=exclude_coinbase` configuration option has been removed.
  The `receivedby` RPCs (`listreceivedbyaddress`, `listreceivedbylabel`,
  `getreceivedbyaddress` and `getreceivedbylabel`) now always return results
  accounting for received coins from coinbase outputs, without an option to
  change that behaviour. Excluding coinbases was previously deprecated in 23.0.
  (#25171)

- The `deprecatedrpc=fees` configuration option has been removed. The top-level
  fee fields `fee`, `modifiedfee`, `ancestorfees` and `descendantfees` are no
  longer returned by RPCs `getmempoolentry`, `getrawmempool(verbose=true)`,
  `getmempoolancestors(verbose=true)` and `getmempooldescendants(verbose=true)`.
  The same fee fields can be accessed through the `fees` object in the result.
  The top-level fee fields were previously deprecated in 23.0. (#25204)

Changes to wallet related RPCs can be found in the Wallet section below.

New RPCs
--------

- The `sendall` RPC spends specific UTXOs to one or more recipients
  without creating change. By default, the `sendall` RPC will spend
  every UTXO in the wallet. `sendall` is useful to empty wallets or to
  create a changeless payment from select UTXOs. When creating a payment
  from a specific amount for which the recipient incurs the transaction
  fee, continue to use the `subtractfeefromamount` option via the
  `send`, `sendtoaddress`, or `sendmany` RPCs. (#24118)

- A new `gettxspendingprevout` RPC has been added, which scans the mempool to find
  transactions spending any of the given outpoints. (#24408)

Updated REST APIs
-----------------

- The `/headers/` and `/blockfilterheaders/` endpoints have been updated to use
  a query parameter instead of path parameter to specify the result count. The
  count parameter is now optional, and defaults to 5 for both endpoints. The old
  endpoints are still functional, and have no documented behaviour change.

  For `/headers`, use
  `GET /rest/headers/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`
  instead of
  `GET /rest/headers/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)

  For `/blockfilterheaders/`, use
  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>?count=<COUNT=5>`
  instead of
  `GET /rest/blockfilterheaders/<FILTERTYPE>/<COUNT>/<BLOCK-HASH>.<bin|hex|json>` (deprecated)

  (#24098)


Build System
------------

Updated settings
----------------


Changes to GUI or wallet related settings can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.

New settings
------------

- A new `mempoolfullrbf` option has been added, which enables the mempool to
  accept transaction replacement without enforcing BIP125 replaceability
  signaling. (#25353)

Tools and Utilities
-------------------

Wallet
------

- The `-walletrbf` startup option will now default to `true`. The
  wallet will now default to opt-in RBF on transactions that it creates.

- The `replaceable` option for the `createrawtransaction` and
  `createpsbt` RPCs will now default to `true`. Transactions created
  with these RPCs will default to having opt-in RBF enabled.

- The `wsh()` output descriptor was extended with Miniscript support. You can import Miniscript
  descriptors for P2WSH in a watchonly wallet to track coins, but you can't spend from them using
  the Bitcoin Core wallet yet.
  You can find more about Miniscript on the [reference website](https://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/). (#24148)

- To help prevent fingerprinting transactions created by the Bitcoin Core wallet, change output
  amounts are now randomized. (#24494)

- The `listtransactions`, `gettransaction`, and `listsinceblock`
  RPC methods now include a wtxid field (hash of serialized transaction,
  including witness data) for each transaction.

- The `listsinceblock`, `listtransactions` and `gettransaction` output now contain a new
  `parent_descs` field for every "receive" entry.

- A new optional `include_change` parameter was added to the `listsinceblock` command.

Migrating Legacy Wallets to Descriptor Wallets
---------------------------------------------

An experimental RPC `migratewallet` has been added to migrate Legacy (non-descriptor) wallets to
Descriptor wallets. More information about the migration process is available in the
[documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/managing-wallets.md#migrating-legacy-wallets-to-descriptor-wallets).

- RPC `getreceivedbylabel` now returns an error, "Label not found
  in wallet" (-4), if the label is not in the address book. (#25122)

GUI changes
-----------

- A new menu item to restore a wallet from a backup file has been added (#471).

- Configuration changes made in the bitcoin GUI (such as the pruning setting,
proxy settings, UPNP preferences) are now saved to `<datadir>/settings.json`
file rather than to the Qt settings backend (windows registry or unix desktop
config files), so these settings will now apply to bitcoind, instead of being
ignored. (#15936)

- Also, the interaction between GUI settings and `bitcoin.conf` settings is
simplified. Settings from `bitcoin.conf` are now displayed normally in the GUI
settings dialog, instead of in a separate warning message ("Options set in this
dialog are overridden by the configuration file: -setting=value"). And these
settings can now be edited because `settings.json` values take precedence over
`bitcoin.conf` values. (#15936)

Low-level changes
=================

RPC
---

- The `deriveaddresses`, `getdescriptorinfo`, `importdescriptors` and `scantxoutset` commands now
  accept Miniscript expression within a `wsh()` descriptor. (#24148)

- The `getaddressinfo`, `decodescript`, `listdescriptors` and `listunspent` commands may now output
  a Miniscript descriptor inside a `wsh()` where a `wsh(raw())` descriptor was previously returned. (#24148)

Tests
