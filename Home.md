# Bitcoin Core developer wiki

This wiki contains design documentation for the Bitcoin Core node and wallet.
The documentation is in a draft stage (potentially about future changes) and may be incorporated into the git repository when it is mature enough.
Mature Bitcoin Core related documentation can be found in [the in-repo /doc folder](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/doc) (general user and developer documentation) and the [docs](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs) repository (more loosely coupled documentation such as gitian building).

The wiki is also used for collaborative editing of the release notes draft.

For notes on documentation of the Bitcoin protocol, please use the [bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/) or [btcinformation.org](https://btcinformation.org/en/developer-reference)

## Request write-access

To prevent spam, this wiki is read-only, but you can request write access in the `bitcoin-core-dev` IRC channel or by creating an issue in the Bitcoin Core repository.
