# Bitcoin Core developer wiki

This wiki contains design documentation for the Bitcoin Core node and wallet.
The documentation is in a draft stage (potentially about future changes) and may be incorporated into the git repository when it is mature enough.
Mature Bitcoin Core related documentation can be found in [the in-repo /doc folder](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tree/master/doc) (general user and developer documentation) and the [docs](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/docs) repository (more loosely coupled documentation).

The wiki is also used for collaborative editing of the release notes draft.

For notes on documentation of the Bitcoin protocol, please use the [bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/) or [btcinformation.org](https://btcinformation.org/en/developer-reference)

## Request write-access

To prevent spam, this wiki is read-only, but you can request write access in the `bitcoin-core-dev` IRC channel or by creating an issue in the Bitcoin Core repository.
